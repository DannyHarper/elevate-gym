# Elevate Gym

You can view the live site here

The Elevate Gym website is designed to provide an accessible, and visually appealing experience for both current gym members and potential new members. 

The website follows modern UX design principles to include ease of use, accessibility, and engagement.

## User Experience (UX)

* ### User Stories

  * #### First Time Visitor Goals

    a. As a first time visitor, I want to quickly understand the range of services and facilities the gym offers so that I can decide if it meets my fitness needs.

    b. As a first time visitor, I want to see detailed information about the classes available, including schedules and descriptions, so I can plan which classes to attend.

    c. As a first time visitor, I want to understand the different membership plans and their benefits so that I can choose the best option for me.

    d. As a first-time visitor, I want to find the gym’s address, and contact details easily so I can visit or get in touch with any questions.

  * #### Returning Visitor Goals 

  a. As a returning visitor, I want to quickly access the current class schedule to plan my visits for the week.

  b. As a returning visitor, I want to review the benefits of my membership and see if there are any new perks or upgrades available.

  c. As a returning visitor, I want to learn more about the gym’s  mission, and values to feel more connected to the community.


  * #### Frequent Visitor Goals 

  a. As a frequent user, I want to quickly find information about the classes I regularly attend, including any last-minute changes or updates.

  b. As a frequent user, I want to stay connected with the gym community by reading about the trainers and staff.

  c. As a frequent user, I want an easy way to provide feedback or suggestions to the gym management to help improve my experience.


## Design

* ### Colour Scheme

I was very careful when choosing the colours, I wanted to make sure of good contrast, but also wanted to stay away from pure blacks & whites as much as possible, as I'm aware of some research suggesting too much of this can cause headaches and in some cases migraines. So, I used off versions of these colours where possible.

* Header & Footer - #1c1c1e
* Buttons/CTAs - #00e5ff
* Text on light backgrounds - #0a1128 & #1c1c1e
* Text on dark backgrounds - #f5f5f5 mostly
* Icons - #f5f5f5
* Hover on nav - #00e5ff

* ### Typography

• I was thinking of using two different fonts, but decided to stick with Montserrat throughout the whole website to keeo everything clean and consistent. 
 Sans Serif is the back up incase the original font doesn't work properly. 

* ### Images

• Images help to build trust, so I wanted to include images of people enjoing the facilities but also not too much, as to overwhelm and take away from the main point of the website.


* ### Videos

• Videos also help build trust, I feel like in today's busy world videos are also easier to digest than writing, so I made sure to include a couple of videos where appropriate. 

* ### Map Integration

• I felt like for this website, an address on it's own wasn't very clear, a map integration pointing directly to where the gym is will be a big help to the users.

## Wireframes

![Home Page](home-page.png)

* I wanted to opt for  a very simple and to the point design for the whole website but especially the home page.
  As soon as the user lands, they know exactly what the website is about.

![Classes](Classes.png)

* The class page is again very simple, very clear and aesthetic class timetable, along with some images of members enjoying the classes.

![Membership](Membership.png)

* The membership options are very clear, gives the user a very quick and clear overview of what is included in each one, leaving no room for confusion and the sign up button below each.
![About Us](about-us.png)

* Again, simplistic approach, clarly detail who the staff are and their roles. The location is very clearly detailed by integrating google maps, allows the user to plan thier journey.

![Sign Up](sign-up-2.png)

* Very simple and to the point sign up form, the idea is that they fill out thier details and thier membership details are sent to them via email.


 ## Feautures

 • The website is fully responsive on all screen sizes.
 • Accessible in terms of careful thought on colour scheme, alt text to describe photos for screen readers.
 • There are interactive feautures such as the vidoes and map.
